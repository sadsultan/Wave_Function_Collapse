# Wave_Function_Collapse

This repository follows me learning about and trying to implement wave function collapse to create new patterns using tile pack placed in the tiles folder. Names of the tiles must be descriptive and the TILEKEY object must be update to reflect the changes and the new rules that must be implemented.

This code is not perfect and it may at times output a pattern that does not completely follow the rules, this is due to the fact that the algorithm used to reduce the tiles possibilities takes one tile at a time and is effectively blind to the tiles around it. This can and will be fixed through future bug fixes, but for now it down remain an issue. It will require backtracking to be implemented.
